# Native image config

DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS FOLDER.

This has been generated by doing a run of the compiled app with
the [GraalVM Tracing Agent](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/).
The goal is to support Apache POI.

To run the tracing agent:

```shell
./gradlew assemble
java -Dspring.aot.enabled=true \
        -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=simple/src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image \
        -jar \
        simple/build/libs/simple-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Don't forget to run the export through `http://localhost:8080/book/export` so that Apache POI code paths are triggered.
