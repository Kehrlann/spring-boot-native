<h1>Spring ❤️ GraalVM</h1>
<p>Here is a list of things that work and don't work out-of-the-box with Spring in Native Images.</p>


<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>This page is generated with a simple Thymeleaf template. By the way, this page was loaded at <span
        th:text="${now}"></span>.</p>

<p>Conclusion: thymeleaf (and other) templates are fine. So you can even pass variables, wow.</p>


<h2>Templating Strikes Back</h2>
<p>Actually, some things don't work in templates. Specifically, any non-primitive type.</p>

<h2>Other magic strings</h2>
<p>Everytime you have string that contains code, there will be reflection involved. This applies,
    for example, to <strong>@PreAuthorize("...")</strong> method security.</p>
<p><a href="/authorization">Take a look</a></p>

<h2>Serializing to/from JSON</h2>
<p>Writing to, and reading from, JSON requires knowing the property names of the objects you are
    (de)serialization, and that means reflection.</p>
